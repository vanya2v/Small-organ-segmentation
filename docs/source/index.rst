DLTK documentation
==================

DLTK is a neural networks toolkit written in python, on top of `TensorFlow
<https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow>`_. It is developed to enable fast
prototyping with a low entry threshold and ensure reproducibility in image
analysis applications, with a particular focus on medical imaging. Its goal is
to provide the community with state of the art methods and models and to
accelerate research in this exciting field.

Getting started
---------------

For installation instructions and getting started please refer to the
`README.md <https://github.com/DLTK/DLTK/tree/master>`_. DLTK-specific
tutorials and notebooks can be found in `dltk/examples/tutorials
<https://github.com/DLTK/DLTK/tree/master/examples/tutorials>`_ and full
examples with downloadable pre-trained models in
`dltk/examples/applications <https://github
.com/DLTK/DLTK/tree/master/examples/applications>`_ in the source.

Model Zoo
---------

We also provide a `model zoo <https://github.com/DLTK/models>`_ in a separate
repository for hosting (re-)implementations of existing or newly published
work. For additional information and contact details, please refer to the
individual README.md file in the code.
